# Ivan Pintado
## Software Developer

------
I have been working as a professional developer since 2012. My experience has been a mix of web development and native applications and mobile, primarily in Node.js, Qt , Java and Kotlin.
I currently focus on building backend services using Node.js but I'm always open to learning new technologies. I have worked with frameworks such as Restify, Express, Hapi, Angular and React.
Last year I lead the effort to port our main mobile app from iOS to Android using react-native.
