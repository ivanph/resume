# Ivan Pintado
## Software Developer

------
I have been working as a professional developer since 2012. My experience has been a mix of web development and native applications, primarily in Node.js, Qt , Java and PHP.
I currently focus on building backend services using Node.js but I'm always open to learning new technologies. I have worked with frameworks such as Restify, Express, Hapi, Angular and React.
Recently I've been dabbling in mobile development using react-native and Java/Kotlin, last year I lead the effort to create
an Android app for our main product.
